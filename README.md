## Report: Predict Bike Sharing Demand with AutoGluon Solution
### Name: Omer Shechter

## General 
This Readme file is the report of my work on the Predicted Bike Sharing Demand. 
Main stages :
1. Connect to Kaggkle and load the data 
2. Initial review of the data 
3. Build a simple model 
4. Submit to Kaggle 
5. Perform an exploratory data 
6. Add Features 
7. 	Add More Features 
8. Review feature importance - remove features 
9. Hyper Tune parameters 
10. Write the report 


## Initial Training
### What did you realize when you tried to submit your predictions? What changes were needed to the output of the predictor to submit your results?
There is a need to verify that the output data doesn't contain negative values.
### What was the top ranked model that performed?

Top Score test was ~43   Top Val score was ~118
Kaggle submission  : 1.38952


## Exploratory data analysis and feature creation
###  What did the exploratory analysis find and how did you add additional features?

Note:  Partial plot â€“ full graph is in the notebook 

## How much better did your model preform after adding additional features and why do you think that is?
Various models were trained:   
1.	Basic Features (like Weekday, Month and etc. as categorical)
2.	Log transformation 
3.	Use of Count data (see diagram) to create time-based features 
4.	Use only high importance features
