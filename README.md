## Report: Predict Bike Sharing Demand with AutoGluon Solution
### Name: Omer Shechter

## General 
This Readme file is the report of my work on the Predicted Bike Sharing Demand. 
Main stages :
1. Connect to Kaggkle and load the data 
2. Initial review of the data 
3. Build a simple model 
4. Submit to Kaggle 
5. Perform an exploratory data 
6. Add Features 
7. 	Add More Features 
8. Review feature importance - remove features 
9. Hyper Tune parameters 
10. Write the report 


## Initial Training
### What did you realize when you tried to submit your predictions? What changes were needed to the output of the predictor to submit your results?
There is a need to verify that the output data doesn't contain negative values.
### What was the top ranked model that performed?

Top Score test was ~43   Top Val score was ~118
Kaggle submission  : 1.38952


## Exploratory data analysis and feature creation
###  What did the exploratory analysis find and how did you add additional features?

Note:  Partial plot â€“ full graph is in the notebook 

## How much better did your model preform after adding additional features and why do you think that is?
Various models were trained:   
1.	Basic Features (like Weekday, Month and etc. as categorical)
2.	Log transformation 
3.	Use of Count data (see diagram) to create time-based features 
4.	Use only high importance features

Here are the results:

## Hyper parameter tuning

Hyperparameters tunning included
1.	Increasing the time
2.	Changing the evaluation matric (customize to RMSLE)
3.	Changing baggin paramters
4.	Trying search parameters 
Some results examples

### How much better did your model preform after trying different hyper parameters?
Kaggle's score was improved from 0.45194  to 0.44793  mainly due to the increase of the time training. All other parameters tunning was a bit less or no improvement. I suspect that the tunning of the parameter was overfitting to the train.   
### If you were given more time with this dataset, where do you think you would spend more time?
I would try to create and try manual train and validation, in order to better select it, in order to try and avoid overfitting 
Also, I would try a lot more parameters  for the GBM models as I would expect it would get the best results
### Create a table with the models you ran, the hyperparameters modified, and the kaggle score.

### Create a line plot showing the top model score for the three (or more) training runs during the project.


#### Score results of the best models
